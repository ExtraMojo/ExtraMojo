ExtraMojo is a collection of useful things that aren't (yet) in the standard library.

## Synopsis

Mojo is a rapidly evolving language, and the standard library choses to not implement some things yet since language feature will greatly change how those things are implemented.
ExtraMojo is here to fill the gap.
All APIs here are subject to change to keep up with new Mojo releases.

## Design Goals

All things in ExtraMojo follow the guidelines of Correctness > Performance > Ergonomics.
Much of what you find here has been inspired by the Rust standard library, and I'd encourage all contributors to base implementations off the Rust impl when in doubt.
