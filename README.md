# ExtraMojo

Extra functionality to extend the Mojo std lib.

*Supports mojo 24.5.0 (e8aacb9)*

## Install / Usage

See docs for [numojo](https://github.com/Mojo-Numerics-and-Algorithms-group/NuMojo/tree/v0.3?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-install) and just do that for this package until Mojo has true package / library support.

tl;dr;

In your project `mojo run -I "../ExtraMojo" my_example_file.mojo`.
Not the bit about how to add this project to your LSP so things resolve in VSCode.


## Tasks

```
magic run test
